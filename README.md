## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** with pip
- **Node.js 16+** and npm
- **SSH access** to your remote server(s)
- **Root privileges** on the remote server (for Xray installation)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd vless-daddy
   ```

2. **Set up the Backend:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up the Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
   ```

## How to Run

1. **Start the Application:**
   ```bash
   python backend/main.py
   ```

2. **Access the Web Interface:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

The application will automatically:
- Initialize the SQLite database
- Serve the React frontend
- Provide API endpoints for proxy management

## Usage Guide

### Creating Your First Proxy

1. Click **"Create New Server"** from the dashboard
2. Fill in the server details:
   - **Server IP:** Your remote server's IP address
   - **SSH User:** Username with root privileges (usually `root`)
   - **SSH Password:** Password for SSH access
   - **Masking Domain:** Domain to mask traffic (e.g., `microsoft.com`)
   - **Proxy Name:** A friendly name for identification
3. Watch the real-time progress as the system:
   - Connects to your server
   - Installs Xray if needed
   - Generates security keys
   - Configures the proxy
   - Verifies the connection

### Managing Clients

1. From the dashboard, click **"Manage Clients"** for any server
2. **Add clients:** Enter a username and click "Add Client"
3. **View connection details:** Click "Show" to see:
   - Client UUID
   - VLESS connection string
   - QR code for mobile apps
4. **Monitor traffic:** View real-time upload/download statistics
5. **Remove clients:** Click "Delete" to remove access

### Traffic Monitoring

- **Real-time Statistics:** Traffic data updates automatically
- **Usage Breakdown:** See both total traffic and upload/download separately
- **Reset Counters:** Use "Reset Traffic" to clear all statistics
- **Refresh Data:** Click "Refresh Traffic" for the latest numbers

## Development

### Backend Development
```bash
python backend/main.py
```
The FastAPI server runs with auto-reload enabled for development.

### Frontend Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```
This starts the React development server with hot-reloading at `http://localhost:3000`, which proxies API requests to the backend.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/servers` - List all managed servers
- `POST /api/proxy` - Create a new proxy server
- `GET /api/servers/{id}/clients` - List clients for a server
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/clients` - Add a new client
- `DELETE /api/servers/{id}/clients/{client_id}` - Remove a client
- `GET /api/servers/{id}/traffic` - Get traffic statistics
- `POST /api/servers/{id}/reset_traffic` - Reset traffic counters

## Security Considerations

- **Local Operation:** The application runs locally and stores data in a local SQLite database
- **SSH Security:** Uses standard SSH authentication; consider using SSH keys for enhanced security
- **Traffic Encryption:** All proxy traffic is encrypted using XTLS-Reality
- **No External Dependencies:** No data is sent to external services

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Connection failed"** - Check SSH credentials and server accessibility
2. **"Xray installation failed"** - Ensure the server has internet access and root privileges
3. **"Traffic shows 0 bytes"** - Generate some traffic through the proxy, then refresh statistics
4. **Database errors** - Delete `vless_daddy.db` to reset (will lose all server data)

### Server Requirements

- **Ubuntu/Debian** Linux distribution (recommended)
- **Root access** for Xray installation
- **Port 443** available for proxy traffic
- **Internet connectivity** for downloading Xray

## Important Notes

- The database file `vless_daddy.db` is automatically created and excluded from Git
- Server data is stored locally - back up the database file if needed
- When updating the application, you may need to delete the database file if the schema changes
- Each proxy server can handle multiple clients with individual traffic tracking
- The application is designed for personal/small-scale use
